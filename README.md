> **YourBench** is an open-source framework for generating domain-specific benchmarks in a zero-shot manner, inspired by modern software testing practices. It aims to keep your large language models on their toes—even as new data sources, domains, and knowledge demands evolve.

**Highlights**:
- **Dynamic Benchmark Generation**: Produce diverse, up-to-date questions from real-world source documents (PDF, Word, HTML, even multimedia).
- **Scalable & Structured**: Seamlessly handles ingestion, summarization, and multi-hop chunking for large or specialized datasets.
- **Zero-Shot Focus**: Emulates real-world usage scenarios by creating fresh tasks that guard against memorized knowledge.
- **Extensible**: Out-of-the-box pipeline stages (ingestion, summarization, question generation), plus an easy plugin mechanism to accommodate custom models or domain constraints.

## Quick Start (Alpha)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/yourbench.git
cd yourbench

# Use uv to install the dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync

# 3. Get a key from https://openrouter.ai/ and add it to the .env file (or make your own config with a different model!)
touch .env
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your_openrouter_api_key>" >> .env

# 4. Run the pipeline with an example config
yourbench --config configs/example.yaml
```

You can also launch a minimal Gradio UI by including `--gui`. 
It will let you interactively explore your pipeline stages.

**Note**: The above instructions are a work-in-progress, and more comprehensive usage info will be provided soon.
