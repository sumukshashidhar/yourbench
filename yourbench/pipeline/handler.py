# handler.py
# =============================================================================
# Author: @sumukshashidhar
#
# This module orchestrates the YourBench pipeline stages in a specified order.
# It reads pipeline configuration from a config dictionary, runs each stage
# if enabled, times each stage’s execution, logs errors to stage-specific
# log files, and finally generates an overall timing chart of all stages.
#
# Usage:
#     from yourbench.pipeline.handler import run_pipeline
#     run_pipeline("/path/to/config.yaml", debug=True)
#
# The module assumes the presence of pipeline stages named after their .py
# files (e.g., ingestion, summarization), each exposing a `run(config: dict)`.
#
# Stages are executed in a fixed default order but will skip any that
# do not appear in the config or are explicitly disabled. Unrecognized
# stages in the config are also noted (but not executed).
#
# Key Responsibilities:
# 1. Load the user’s pipeline configuration.
# 2. Execute each stage in `DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER` if `run` is True in the config.
# 3. Log all events, including errors, to a stage-specific file and the console.
# 4. Collect and display timing data for each stage.
# 5. Detect any extra pipeline stages in the config that do not appear in
#    `DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER` and log a warning about them.

    Run the YourBench pipeline based on a provided YAML configuration file.

    This function:
      1. Loads the pipeline configuration from `config_file_path`.
      2. Iterates over the `DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER` and executes each stage
         if it is present and enabled (`run = True`) in the config.
      3. Logs errors for each stage to a dedicated file in `logs/` named
         `pipeline_<stage_name>.log`.
      4. Records the start and end time of each stage to produce a timing chart.
      5. Logs warnings for any stages in the config that are not part
         of `DEFAULT_STAGE_ORDER`.

        config_file_path (str):
            Path to the YAML configuration file that describes how

            Indicates whether to run in debug mode (more verbose logging).

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError:
            If the configuration file is not found at the specified path.
        Exception:
            If any stage raises an unexpected error during execution, the
            error is re-raised after being logged.
