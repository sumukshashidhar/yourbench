> **YourBench** is an open-source framework for generating domain-specific benchmarks in a zero-shot manner. It aims to keep your large language models on their toes‚Äîeven as new data sources, domains, and knowledge demands evolve.

**Highlights**:
- **Dynamic Benchmark Generation**: Produce diverse, up-to-date questions from real-world source documents (PDF, Word, HTML, even multimedia).
- **Scalable & Structured**: Seamlessly handles ingestion, summarization, and multi-hop chunking for large or specialized datasets.
- **Zero-Shot Focus**: Emulates real-world usage scenarios by creating fresh tasks that guard against memorized knowledge.
- **Extensible**: Out-of-the-box pipeline stages (ingestion, summarization, question generation), plus an easy plugin mechanism to accommodate custom models or domain constraints.

---

## Quick Start (Alpha)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/yourbench.git
cd yourbench

# Use uv to install the dependencies
# pip install uv # if you do not have uv already
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
uv pip install -e .

# 3. Get a key from https://openrouter.ai/ and add it to the .env file (or make your own config with a different model!)
touch .env
echo "HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>" >> .env
echo "HF_ORGANIZATION=<your_HF_username_or_organization>" >> .env

# 4. Run the pipeline with an example config
yourbench run --config example/configs/example.yaml
```

**Note**: The above instructions are a work-in-progress, and more comprehensive usage info will be provided soon.

## Key Features

- **Automated Benchmark Generation**  
  Generate question-answer pairs that test LLMs on specific domains or knowledge slices, derived directly from your raw documents.

- **Flexible Pipeline**  
  Each stage (ingestion, summarization, chunking, multi-/single-hop QG, deduplication) can be enabled or disabled via YAML config. Fine-grained control allows minimal or comprehensive runs.

- **Robust Config System**  
  A single YAML config controls model roles, data paths, chunking parameters, question generation instructions, deduplication thresholds, etc.

- **Multi-Model Ensemble Support**  
  Use different LLMs for ingestion, summarization, question generation, or answering. This fosters broader coverage and question style diversity.

- **Deduplication & Quality Filtering**  
  Automatic grouping of near-duplicate questions to prune and keep a curated set.

- **Extensive Logging & Analysis**  
  Built-in modules measure dataset coverage, question distribution, difficulty metrics, and more. 

- **Public or Private**  
  Optionally push ingested or generated data to the Hugging Face Hub or keep it local.

- **Extensible**  
  Each pipeline step is modular. Easily add custom question-generation prompts, chunking logic, or domain-specific expansions.

## Core Concepts & Workflow

YourBench follows a multi-stage approach:

1. **Document Ingestion**  
   Convert PDFs, HTML, Word, or text into a standardized Markdown format.

2. **Summarization**  
   Generate a concise "global summary" for each document, using a designated summarization LLM.

3. **Chunking**  
   Split or chunk documents (and optionally combine multiple smaller segments) based on text similarity or length constraints.

4. **Question Generation**  
   - **Single-Shot**: Create straightforward, single-chunk questions.  
   - **Multi-Hop**: Combine multiple chunks to produce more complex, integrative questions.

5. **Deduplication**  
   Remove or group near-duplicate questions across your dataset using embedding-based similarity.

6. **Analysis**  
   Evaluate question distribution, difficulty, coverage, or run custom analyses.

7. **Export**  
   The resulting question sets can be stored locally or uploaded as a new dataset on the Hugging Face Hub.
